# Decision Under Uncertainty

A practical framework for making sound decisions when you lack complete information, face ambiguity, or cannot predict outcomes with confidence.

## Why Uncertainty Matters

Every meaningful decision involves some degree of uncertainty. Whether you are choosing a career path, making an investment, launching a product, or deciding on a medical treatment, you rarely have all the information you need. The difference between good and poor decision-makers is not the ability to eliminate uncertainty but the ability to navigate it systematically.

Research in behavioral economics has shown that humans are remarkably poor at intuitive probability assessment. We overweight vivid scenarios, anchor on irrelevant numbers, and confuse confidence with accuracy. A structured approach to decision-making under uncertainty can dramatically improve outcomes across all domains of life.

For building and maintaining personal decision rules that work even under uncertainty, [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) provides a structured platform to codify your decision-making principles.

## Types of Uncertainty

### Risk vs. Uncertainty
Frank Knight distinguished between two fundamentally different situations:

- **Risk**: The possible outcomes are known and probabilities can be estimated (e.g., rolling a die, insurance actuarial tables)
- **Uncertainty**: The possible outcomes may be unknown, and probabilities cannot be reliably estimated (e.g., launching a novel product, geopolitical shifts)

Most real-world decisions involve a blend of both. The framework in this guide addresses both dimensions.

### Levels of Uncertainty

| Level | Description | Example | Approach |
|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| Level 1 | Clear enough future | Established market with known trends | Standard forecasting |
| Level 2 | Alternate futures | Election outcomes, regulatory changes | Scenario planning |
| Level 3 | Range of futures | Emerging technology markets | Range-based analysis |
| Level 4 | True ambiguity | Revolutionary disruption | Adaptive strategy |

## The Decision Framework

### Step 1: Map the Decision Space

Before analyzing options, clearly define what you are deciding and what factors matter. Write down the decision statement, the key objectives, the constraints you face, and the time horizon for the decision and its consequences.

### Step 2: Identify What You Know and Do Not Know

Create an explicit inventory of your knowledge:

- **Known knowns**: Facts and data you have and understand
- **Known unknowns**: Questions you know you need answered
- **Unknown unknowns**: Gaps you have not yet identified (seek diverse perspectives to surface these)

### Step 3: Assess Probabilities

For each possible outcome, estimate the likelihood using the best available evidence. Be explicit about your confidence level and the basis for your estimates. Use reference class forecasting when possible -- look at how similar decisions have played out historically rather than relying on inside-view analysis.

### Step 4: Evaluate Consequences

For each outcome, assess both the magnitude and the reversibility of the consequences. A decision with asymmetric payoffs (limited downside, large upside) should be treated very differently from one with symmetric risk.

### Step 5: Apply Decision Rules

Rather than agonizing over each decision from scratch, develop standing rules for recurring situations. Examples include:

- "Never risk more than X percent of capital on a single position"
- "If the expected value is positive and the worst case is survivable, proceed"
- "When two options are close, choose the more reversible one"

You can organize and track these rules using [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com), which helps you build a personal library of decision principles that improve over time.

### Step 6: Decide and Document

Make the decision, but equally important, document your reasoning. Record what you knew, what you assumed, what probabilities you assigned, and why you chose as you did. This creates a decision journal that enables learning regardless of the outcome.

## Key Mental Models for Uncertainty

### Expected Value Thinking
Multiply the probability of each outcome by its value and sum the results. Choose the option with the highest expected value when the number of decisions is large enough for the law of large numbers to apply.

### Minimax Regret
When probabilities are truly unknown, consider which decision you would regret least across all possible outcomes. This approach minimizes maximum regret rather than maximizing expected value.

### Options Thinking
When possible, structure decisions to preserve optionality. Pay a small cost now to maintain the ability to choose later when you have more information. Real options analysis from finance applies broadly to life decisions.

### Bayesian Updating
Start with a prior probability estimate and update it systematically as new evidence arrives. Avoid both anchoring too strongly on initial estimates and overreacting to new data.

### Pre-Mortem Analysis
Before committing, imagine the decision has failed and work backward to identify what went wrong. This surfaces risks that optimism bias would otherwise hide.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Analysis Paralysis**: Gathering more information past the point of diminishing returns
2. **Overconfidence**: Assigning probabilities that are too narrow
3. **Anchoring**: Letting irrelevant reference points distort your estimates
4. **Availability Bias**: Overweighting scenarios that come easily to mind
5. **Neglect of Base Rates**: Ignoring how often things actually happen in favor of narrative reasoning
6. **Outcome Bias**: Judging past decisions by their results rather than the quality of the reasoning process

## Practical Tools

### Decision Matrix Template

| Option | Probability of Success | Best Case Value | Worst Case Value | Expected Value | Reversibility |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| A | | | | | |
| B | | | | | |
| C | | | | | |

### Uncertainty Checklist

- Have I considered at least three possible outcomes for each option?
- Have I checked base rates for similar decisions?
- Have I sought perspectives from people who disagree with me?
- Can I survive the worst-case scenario?
- Have I documented my reasoning for future review?

## Building a Decision System

The most effective approach to decision-making under uncertainty is not to treat each decision in isolation but to build a systematic practice. Track your decisions, review outcomes, and refine your rules over time. Platforms like [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) are designed specifically to help you maintain and evolve your personal decision-making framework so that you improve with every decision you make.
